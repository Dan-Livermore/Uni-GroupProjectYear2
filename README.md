## About Client
### About Face IT
Face IT is a service that provides support and advice for anyone who has worries or is unhappy because they have a different or unusual appearance - what we call a visible difference.\
Face IT has been designed by experts in the field of appearance psychology and people with a range of conditions that affect appearance who understand the types of worries and problems you might be experiencing.\
There are 8 sessions in Face IT. Each session has different exercises and activities and will take 45 - 60
minutes to complete.

### Why It's Important
Face IT helps people learn new skills and gives them useful tips so they feel more confident about the way they look, allowing them to feel more comfortable meeting new people and being with friends, going to the shops, playing sport, or going to work.\
Face IT also allows people to test out social situations that they might find difficult on the computer, so that they can practice how to manage them and increase their confidence before trying it out for real.

## Aims Of Project

- Group Z’s vision for the project is that we will design and produce a new website for the FaceIT charity. 
- The website will function as a web page application that will be accessible from multiple platforms for many different types of users, whether they are on their laptop, mobile, tablet or desktop.  
- The new website will aim to preserve the content and functionality of the original one, whilst making minor adjustments or additions provided, enhancing the UX (user experience) or accessibility. 
- As the client is a charity, Group Z will approach this project with the goal of being as low cost and as low maintenance as possible, based on the initial meeting gathered requirements. 
- Propose a website front and back-end design will designed to be as simple and accessible as possible.

## Main Page

### Project Features
Quick Access Menu Update
>One change we brought to the project is a quick access menu update. Updating the old UI to allow an easier access to the different sections of the service
for the users.\
We also updated it to be more contemporary, and fit more into the current day designs of headers on other pages, since that is what most online users would be
accustomed to.\
We also implemented a responsive UI allowing the webpage to adapt to better fit the user regardless of the device they use to access the page, allowing an
easy access from mobile devices, a a feature that the client requested which was previously a difficult task.\

Web Content
>We kept the old web content for the main page as it would be a comfortable design for the existing users of the service. We updated certain sections to keep a consistency with the rest of the webpage.

Web Footer
>We updated the footer to be less crowded and to only display the details that were necessary for the page.

Quick Access Menu Update
>As the client had no reliable way to update their news section without a full web page update, we implemented a Twitter embed for the team to use.\
This allows the team to network and grow in the community through social media and to share updates directly to their site without having to make changes to the
page itself.\
This also helps the team save money as they no longer need to pay to update their news section with each update they have to post.\
