                          We've already talked about how an unusual appearance can make socialising difficult, because people may want to ask you lots of questions, they may feel embarrassed, awkward, or feel sorry for you. These responses can make you feel defensive or upset and maybe you don't want people to feel sorry for you!
                          The SCARED model explains why socialising can be difficult and can sometimes go wrong. If you understand why social situations can go wrong, you can learn ways to handle them better.
                          The SCARED diagram below shows that if we use negative social skills, socialising can become difficult:

                      <p>You may find some of them useful, or you may find that you're using some of them already. If you're using some already then you're doing really well - it's techniques like these that will help you succeed! </p>

                            <p>People often want to be reassured that you're OK in yourself.</p>
                            <p>Try using a quick explanation of your difference and add something reassuring to your answer, like:</p>

                            <p>If people stare, don't avoid eye contact, smile at them. This reassures them that you are confident and friendly. Just speaking at all will show you're confident with your appearance and that they should be too!</p>

                            <p>If you're anxious about asking shop assistants for things, being courageous would be to go straight up to them and ask confidently, "do you sell baked beans?", waiting for the answer, thanking them and walking off feeling good about yourself - you managed to overcome a fear.</p>

                            <p>When we talk about 'over there' we mean using ways to get people to stop focusing on your difference.</p>
                            <p>If you don't want to talk about your difference you can distract them by changing the subject. Try asking a question or talking about something you have in common, such as sport, music, hobbies, films - anything that takes the attention off your difference so they stop worrying about your appearance and get onto you as a person!</p>

                            <p>Smiling and eye contact always helps. If you distract someone away from your appearance they'll soon forget any difficulties they may have with it.</p>

                            <p>They may be shocked, worried or embarrassed, if you understand that:</p>
                            <li>You can help them get over it</li>
                            <li>You can remain calm</li>

                            <p>When you're with people, try to put yourself in their shoes and understand what they're feeling. If you feel up to it, try explaining to them about your appearance, but don't go into loads of detail - a little information will help them relax.</p>
                            <p>If they still look uncomfortable try starting a conversation about a different topic - then you can distract them away from your appearance.</p>
