                                          Face IT provides support and advice for anyone who has worries or is unhappy because they have a different or unusual appearance (what we call a visible difference). Conditions that can affect appearance are:
                                      </p>
                                      
      
                                  Skin conditions for example, vitiligo, ichthyosis, eczema, acne, psoriasis or other conditions that affect the texture of the skin such as neurofibromatosis and epidermolysis bullosa
                                  Scarring from accidents, burns or surgery
                                  Alopecia caused by a range of conditions and illnesses
                                  Medical treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy
                                  Conditions from birth, for example birthmarks, cleft lip or other craniofacial conditions
                                  Face IT has been designed by experts in the field of appearance psychology and people with a range of conditions that affect appearance who understand the types of worries and problems you might be experiencing.
      
                                  There are 8 sessions in Face IT. Each session has different exercises and activities and will take 45 - 60 minutes to complete. We'd like you to complete 1 session per week.
