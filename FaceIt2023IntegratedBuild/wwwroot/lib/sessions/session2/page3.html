                                    <p>When we talk to people we spend a lot of time looking at the area around the eyes, nose and mouth. This is why having a facial difference can sometimes be distracting to the person listening and why it's so important for people with facial differences to learn skills to deal with these problems.</p>
                                    <p>The muscles in our face are very complex, our facial expressions can show lots of different emotions, from disgust or dislike through to surprise or happiness.</p>

                                    <p>Everyone will respond slightly differently to this activity, but normally people are more negative about the first picture because she isn't smiling and is looking away from you.</p>
                                    <p>People feel more positive and are a lot happier about meeting the person in the second picture because she seems friendly.</p>
                                    <h4>Smiling is very good for us</h4>
                                    <p>It makes us feel better and shows others that we are confident, friendly and approachable. Try doing it now. Have a go at smiling for one minute and see how you feel.</p>
                                    <p>Before the next session of Face IT have a go at this exercise.</p>
                                    <p>Each morning start the day by smiling at yourself in the mirror or just to yourself if you don't like looking in the mirror. Also try smiling whenever you feel unhappy or low. This should help to lift your mood a bit.</p>

                                  <p>Scarring, muscle damage or nerve damage can affect the way the face moves while you are talking. This can make it difficult to make the right facial movements you need for certain expressions. This makes it harder for others to tell how you feel. Although your difference may make it more confusing for other people to read your emotions, there is something that can help.</p>
                                  <p>Try explaining to people why you can't use facial expressions. Most people will understand your situation and be grateful to you for explaining it.</p>

                                  <p>If you can't smile, use energy and enthusiasm when you talk to people. Read about how Paul manages to communicate without facial expressions.</p>

                                        <p>You should find it much harder to be positive while you're slouched and much harder to feel stressed when you're stood up straight. This shows how good posture can increase confidence.</p>
                                        <h4>Pracice good posture</h4>
                                        <p>Think about how you're sitting and try to straighten your back and keep your shoulders down. Make an effort to practice this position at least once a day.</p>
                                        <p>When you're walking around in the next few weeks try looking up instead of at your feet. Look up at the chimney pots and treetops. This should help you to feel more positive.</p>
                                        <h4>Remember practice makes perfect!</h4>
                                        <p>The first few times you practice your posture, it's likely to feel very odd, but over time it will become more natural to you and eventually you won't have to think about it at all!</p>

                                    <p>Eye contact is looking at someone's eyes when we see them or talk to them (or if you can't look them in the eyes, looking at the bridge of the nose). We say a lot more with our eyes than we ever do with our mouths!</p>

                                          <p>Maintain eye contact to show the listener that you want them to listen to you. The other person's eye contact tells you that they're listening to you and that they're interested in what you're saying. Have you ever tried to talk to someone who is wearing dark glasses? It's very difficult to keep the conversation going as you can find it hard to be sure that they're actually listening.</p>

                                          <p>Keep up a high level of eye contact so that they know you are "tuned in" and understand what they're saying. Also remember that people use eye contact to grab your attention and show you that they want to talk to you.</p>

                                      <p>Gestures are very little movements that aren't very obvious but they tell us a lot about a person. Nodding your head whilst someone is talking to you is just as important as keeping up eye contact. It shows that you're interested and that you understand what they are saying.</p>

                                      <p>It can be really hard work having a conversation with someone who remains completely still and doesn't respond to you.</p>
                                      <p>Head nodding is also important for showing who's turn it is to talk. When someone is listening to you and they want to say something, they tend to start nodding their head more quickly. This gently lets you know to take a break and let them have their say.</p>
                                      <br>
                                      <p>Have a look at a group of people in real life or on TV while they're talking and see if you can spot the use of head nodding.</p>

                                      <p>Hand gestures when you're talking are also important. Moving your hands about to make a point shows confidence.</p>
